# Information

## Additional Information
This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library.  In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute.  The original dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan, 1993)
